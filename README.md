# ipl-win-predictor

# Introduction
The IPL Win Predictor is a machine learning project that predicts the winning probability of an ongoing IPL cricket match based on the current match situation. This project utilizes historical IPL data to train a model that can provide real-time predictions, helping fans and analysts gauge the likely outcome of a match.

# Features
1) Real-time Prediction: Get win probabilities for both teams based on the current score, overs bowled, and wickets fallen.
2) User-friendly Interface: A Streamlit web app providing an interactive and easy-to-use interface.
Comprehensive Data: Utilizes extensive IPL historical data for accurate predictions.
